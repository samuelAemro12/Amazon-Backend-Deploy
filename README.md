# Amazon Clone Backend

This is the backend for the Amazon Clone project, built using Node.js and Express.js. It complements the frontend written in React.js, deployed [here](https://samuel-amazon-clone-deploy.netlify.app/). The backend handles API requests, manages environment variables, and integrates payment processing via Stripe.

## Features

- API routes to support user interactions and product management.
- Secure handling of environment variables using `dotenv`.
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for frontend-backend communication.
- Integration with Stripe for handling payments.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight framework for building API routes.
- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables in a `.env` file.
- **CORS**: Enables secure cross-origin requests.
- **Stripe**: Provides payment processing capabilities.
